Generating reports of world happiness dataset:

file: 'world-happiness-report.csv'

1. extract the names of countries 
	there are 166 countries in the dataset

2. choose some countries for making reports
	10 middle eastern countries: 'Afghanistan', 'Bahrain', 'Egypt', 'Iran', 'Iraq', 'Kuwait', 'Lebanon', 'Oman', 'Palestinian Territories', 'Saudi Arabia'
	
3. group data by country name to detect the outlier ones:
	'Oman' has only one data, not enough data for report, so remove from input ones

4. group data by yaer: 2011 to 2017 all of the chosen countries have all data, but the rest of it (2005-2010 & 2018-2020) it's not complete, so as the 1st try I want to make some reports from the complete data

5. Reports from 2011-2017:
5.1. Compute the mean of 'Life Ladder' values for each year, save the result as linear plot (MeanHappinessValue.png)
	It shows that the most happiest years are 2013 and 2016, the most sadness years are 2012 and 2017
	
5.2. Get the max of 'Life Ladder' values for each year, Extract the related country, show the result as scatter plot (MostHappiest.png)
	It shows that 'Saudi Arabia' is the happiest country between 2011-2017, except one year.
	
note: I customized the size of y axis for better present

6. I want to see what usefull data can be extracted from GDP
	When take a look at the data from GDP, there are some null values that can affect the result, one way to fill this fileds is to set the value of them to the mean of that column.
	
7. Compute the correlation between 'Life Ladder' and other columns, the result shows that 'Life Ladder' is highly correlated with 'Log GDP per Capita' 

file: 'world-happiness-report-2021.csv'
8. There is some new columns here, like 'Regional indicator', contains 10 values for different regions in the world
